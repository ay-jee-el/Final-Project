## Description
A quick little code that will implment pygames and other various codes in order to create an interactive game show.
While more entertaining thn practical, it will allow me to explore such usage of the medium in order to understand Python and hopefully let others enjoy!

## Features
- Multichoice qyestions
	- I will likely need some sort of loop to run each of the questions over than over, along with 
    a spot to store the variables and an interactive elemt (MOUSBUTTONDOWN for ex)
- A proper score
	- An equation that should add up which questions were correct and display thwm to the player. 
- Viuals!
	- Interactove pngs and pdesigns thatll allow the user to click on buttons and mpore!

## Challenges
- Understanding mathematics/ quiz show elements in python.
- Honing in my usage of pygames and understanding its usage.
- Looking into renpy, and seeing if this could assist me?

## Outcomes
- I hope for my outcome to be a properly running quiz with proper visuals and correct calcuations

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- At least being able to display some sort of input/ output within the terminal

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Have renpy and pygames prepared/ understood
  2. Get together questions function

- Week 2
  1. Get together a function to detect what is right or wrong
  2. Work on math of code

- Week N (Final)
  1. Put it all togetger within the main function
